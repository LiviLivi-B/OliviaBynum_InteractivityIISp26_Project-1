    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I highly value the art direction of video games, video games are capable of completely immersing you in it's world. Unfortunately, this part of development is often overlooked. I believe that art direction is important for making a game stand out.</p>

    <p>This is a wonderfully bizarre adventure game where you explore the strange world of ENA. I've always loved surrealism so this game is up my alley. It’s almost incomprehensible but that’s exactly what makes it fun to play through. (Also it is free too so check it out!)

    <p>This classic DS game was heavily inspired by graffiti art and street fashion. It has a timeless look and it really embodies this grungy street aesthetic. The bold sharp lineart is one of the highlights of this game’s art design.

    <p>Another DS game, but it may be one of the most beautiful games on the system. So much passion was put into the design of the world and characters. This really does feel like a team’s passion project coming to life.
