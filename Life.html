    <div><h2> North Carolina</h2>
    <p>I was born and raised in North Carolina, so it has influenced how I live and my art. There are a couple of art reasources here such as the Mint Museums and the Charlotte Art League. Both the artworks inside them and how they work showed me how the visual arts are presented in North Carolina.</p>

    <h2>Food</h2>
    <p>I know this sounds a little strange, but who doesn't like to eat. I cook sometimes but when I see food, how it's made or presented, I feel inspired. I tend to take the appealing aspects of food and put that in my art and designs. It is mainly the color pallettes of asethetic food and the gloss effect. Overall, I want to use the look and feel of food to make my digital art more appealing.</p>

    <h2>Animals</h2>
    <p>The natural world is full of intrestinng concepts and creatures. I like making fantasy settings and characters so you'd think that real life ecosystems would not be a good source of inspiration. But this is not true, in many ways truth is stanger than fiction. From parasitic fungi, wolf body language, the creation of domesticated animals, and more, there is so much happening around me that informs how I draw.</p>
